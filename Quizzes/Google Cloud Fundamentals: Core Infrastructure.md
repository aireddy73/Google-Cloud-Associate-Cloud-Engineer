## Introducing Google Cloud

- Select two fundamental characteristics of cloud computing from this list.

  * [ ] Customers are required to commit to multi-year contracts.
  * [ ] Providers always dedicate physical resources to each customer.
  * [x] Resources are available from anywhere over the network.
  * [ ] All resources are open source.
  * [x] Customers can scale their resource use up and down.

- Which one of the following statements is true regarding the ability to scale cloud computing resources up and down?

  * [ ] Only CPU and memory resources are elastic.
  * [ ] Only storage resources are elastic.
  * [x] CPU, memory, and storage resources are elastic.
  * [ ] Cloud computing does not provide a way to scale resources. 

- What cloud computing service binds application code to libraries that give access to the infrastructure an application needs?

  * [ ] Hybrid cloud
  * [ ] Software as a service
  * [ ] Virtualized data centers
  * [x] Platform as a service
  * [ ] Infrastructure as a service

- What cloud computing service provides raw compute, storage, and network resources that are organized similarly to physical data centers?

  * [ ] Platform as a service
  * [x] Infrastructure as a service
  * [ ] Database as a service
  * [ ] Software as a service

- Why might a Google Cloud customer use resources in several zones within a region?

  * [ ] For better performance
  * [ ] For getting discounts on other zones
  * [x] For improved fault tolerance
  * [ ] For expanding services to customers in new areas

- Who benefits the most from billing by the second for cloud resources, such as virtual machines?

  * [ ] Customers who create virtual machines that run commercially licensed operating systems
  * [ ] Customers who create many virtual machines and leave them running for months
  * [ ] Customers who create too few virtual machines to get discounts
  * [x] Customers who create and run many virtual machines

## Resources and Access in Google Cloud
- When would you choose to have an organization node? (Select two)

  * [x] When you want to create folders
  * [ ] When you want to organize resources into projects
  * [x] When you want to centrally apply organization-wide policies
  * [ ] Thereâ€™s no choice; organization nodes are mandatory.

- Which statement best describes how Google Cloud resources are associated within the resource hierarchy?

  * [x] All Google Cloud resources are associated with a project.
  * [ ] All Google Cloud resources are associated with a folder.
  * [ ] All Google Cloud resources are associated with an organization.
  * [ ] Google Cloud resources are not associated with the resource hierarchy.

- Consider a single hierarchy of Google Cloud resources. Which of these situations is possible? (Choose 3 responses.)

  * [x] There is no organization node, and there are no folders.
  * [ ] There is no organization node, but there is at least one folder.
  * [x] There is an organization node, and there are no folders.
  * [x] There is an organization node, and there is at least one folder.
  * [ ] There are two or more organization nodes.

- Your company has two Google Cloud projects and you want them to share policies. What is the least error-prone way to set this up?

  * [ ] Duplicate all the policies from one project onto the other. 
  * [x] Place both projects into a folder, and define the policies on that folder.
  * [ ] Create shared resource policies on the common resources that are used in both projects.
  * [ ] Define the new shared policy in the organization node.

- What is the difference between Identity and Access Management (IAM) basic roles and IAM predefined roles?

  * [ ] Basic roles only apply to the owner of the Google Cloud project. Predefined roles can be associated with any user. 
  * [x] Basic roles affect all resources in a Google Cloud project. Predefined roles apply to a specific service in a project.
  * [ ] Basic roles can only be granted to single users. Predefined roles can be associated with a group.
  * [ ] Basic roles only allow viewing, creating, and deleting resources. Predefined roles allow any modification.

- Select the option that displays IAM roles from general to specific. 

  * [x] Basic roles, predefined roles, custom roles
  * [ ] Custom roles, predefined roles, basic roles
  * [ ] Predefined roles, custom roles, basic roles

- How does the resource hierarchy control how IAM policies are inherited?

  * [ ] IAM policies that are implemented higher in the resource hierarchy deny access that is granted by lower-level policies.
  * [x] IAM policies that are implemented by lower-level policies can override the policies defined at a higher level. 
  * [ ] IAM policies are only implemented at the project level; they cannot be amended by lower levels of the resource hierarchy. 

- Which way of accessing Google Cloud lets you control services through the code you write?

  * [ ] The Cloud Console
  * [ ] The Cloud SDK and Cloud Shell
  * [x] APIs
  * [ ] The Cloud Console mobile app
